##What's Included in this Examples Repository?

###Code

All examples are contained in separate folders at the root of the repository. Each example contains a Program.java file which always contains the main entry point for the application.

The general structure of each example contains:

- IntelliJ Project files (.ipr, .iml, .iws)
- Program.java (the source code for the example).
- Data folder which contains the input documents and any source files. All generated output produced by the example is also placed into this folder.
- Out folder (created when the example is compiled and contains the compiled classes when the project is built).

###Data

+ Input Documents - Each example contains a Data directory which contains any input Word Documents used in the example.
+ Northwind.mdb - Many examples use this Microsoft Access Database found under the "Database" directory for demonstrating merging data into documents.

###Output

+ Most examples will perform operations on documents and save them into the Data directory. This directory is found inside each of the examples e.g "\(ExampleName)\CSharp\Data\".
+ Other examples print output to the console.
+ Some printing examples will display a print preview dialog and allow you to print the document output.


###Help Material

For further details on setting up the examples and any requirements refer to the readme.txt found in the root of the repository.


##Download the Examples

Please [Download the Aspose.Words for .Java Examples](https://github.com/asposewords/Aspose_Words_Java/downloads) to try them at your end.


##How to use the Examples?

Firstly make sure that you have downloaded and extracted the latest version of [Aspose.Words for Java](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.words-for-java/category1378.aspx). We recommend extracting the Aspose.Words archive at the same location with the examples to ensure all dependencies in the examples can be found.

Download the examples from the above link. There are IntelliJ Idea project files (.ipr) provided for the examples which can be used to easily compile and run each example.

You can choose one of several options to run the examples.

1)
Open the IntelliJ project file using the IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE of the example you wish to run. The example should be ready to compile. Click on "Run" menu and choose one of the following menu items:

- Run
- Debug

2)
The examples are shipped with scripts found at the root: "Compile All.bat" and "Run All.bat". These allow all of the example projects within the folder to be built and run automatically under Windows. 

3)
Create a new project in your favourite Java IDE and choose to create a new project from existing sources. 

- Include all files within the folder of the example that is being compiled. 
- A library reference to Aspose.Words.jar which is found within the lib folder must be added to the project. 
- Depending on the example being compiled, a reference to other Aspose.Words libraries may also be required. These are found under the demos-only-lib folder inside the lib folder.
- Example code which demonstrates conversion of a document to image requires the appropriate ImageIO codecs installed on the system. If one of these codecs is missing it will present itself as a runtime error such as: "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot find an ImageIO writer for the specified format: bmp".
- The entry point for each example is always found at "Program.Main".
